**Workshop Report:** Workshop 3

## System Design and Management Summary  
We refined the system architecture to improve **scalability**, **reliability**, and **maintainability**. The updated design includes a **load balancer**, **database replication**, and a **queueing mechanism** to ensure data integrity and fault tolerance. Monitoring tools such as **Prometheus** or the **ELK Stack** were proposed to track performance and support continuous improvement. The design follows quality standards like **ISO 9001**, **CMMI**, and **Six Sigma**, ensuring process maturity and reduced variability.  

A detailed **risk analysis** was developed for the *Click2Buy* system, covering issues like model drift, data integrity failures, workflow dependencies, and scalability challenges. Each risk includes severity evaluation, mitigation strategies, and monitoring procedures to maintain system robustness.  

For project management, we adopted the **Scrum methodology**, defining clear roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Analyst, and Developer) and using a **Kanban board** to track progress. Key milestones were planned for implementation, simulation, evaluation, and documentation. This workshop consolidates the evolution from analytical design to a robust, managed system ready for implementation in future stages.
