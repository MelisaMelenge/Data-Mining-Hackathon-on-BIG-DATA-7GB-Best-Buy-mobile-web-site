##  Systems Analysis Methodology
First, we analyzed the main goal: predicting user purchase behavior from large scale clickstream data. We reviewed the dataset’s structure, identifying its key components such as user sessions, actions, timestamps, and products, along with the main challenges of data volume, sparsity, and noise.

Next, we conducted a systemic analysis to define the main elements (users, sessions, actions, and products) and their relationships, outlining how information flows through the system. We examined sources of complexity and sensitivity, including behavioral variability, data preprocessing, and model parameter changes. We also considered aspects of chaos and randomness, such as unpredictable user behavior and stochastic effects in data sampling and model training.

Finally, we summarized the main findings, highlighting the system’s strengths (real-world data and high analytical value) and weaknesses (scalability and noise issues). We complemented the report with diagrams illustrating the data flow and system architecture, and organized all deliverables in this GitHub repository, which includes the final PDF report and supporting materials.
