##  Systems Design Methodology

We reviewed the findings from our initial systems analysis, focusing on critical constraints, data characteristics, and any chaos theory factors, ensuring our design ideas addressed these insights. We then translated the analysis into measurable system requirements, including performance, reliability, and user centric needs such as security and ease of use. Following this, we proposed a high level architecture that outlined the data flow and interactions between components, describing each module's responsibility.

To handle sensitivity and chaos factors, we designed strategies to manage unpredictable variables and incorporated error handling routines. We also recommended appropriate tools, justifying their use for the implementation, and provided a brief plan for integrating components based on best practices.
